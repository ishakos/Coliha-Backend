working directory (l folder li rak t5dem fih)
git add m3ntha u go to the staging area
git commit m3ntha u go to the local repo
git push m3ntha u go from local repo to remote repo

-Clone: (m repo l ur local folder, kima l pull) 
git clone aLinkTsiboInYourRepo.git ==> he will get that repo into ur local folder

-Difference between pull and clone: 
git clone : is used to create a local copy of an entire remote repository.
git pull : is used to update your local repository with the changes from the remote repository, bringing those changes into your current branch

-reset & restore: (l3ks te3 git add)
supposing that u added a file by mistake into the stage area, how to unstage?
method1:  git reset head file.txt (old way)
method2: git restore --staged file.txt (new and better way)

-clean: (delete untracked files)
git clean -n: ywerilk chkon li rah ytsuprimaw
git clean -f: confirm the delete
note: if u wanna save a file dirlo git add

-git branch: ywerilk l branches li 3ndek (master / main)
-git remote -v: ywerilk l remotes li 3ndek (origin)

-git push remoteName BranchName ==> git push origin main - git push origin master
push from local repo to remote repo
note: to push u need to log in ur github acc, mchi li yji yenjem ypushi psq ki t5dem f charika ur repo is private (fl vscode rani mlinkiha)
note2: ida sra changes ml github, you need to pull the new changes from remote repo to ur local repo before pushing again

-Branches: (chghol copies)
rak hab tzid feature fl ur project, te5demha f new branch w testiha fih
git branch newBranch (create new branch)
git checkout newBranch (move to newBranch)
git branch -d newBranch (deleted)
git branch -m newBranchName (current branch renamed)

-Pull Request: (a request to merge your code update to the main project)
u push ur new code into it ur mesweda branch, mb3d troh l github dir pull request, from your mesweda branch to the master branch, ida galk able to merge (there is no conflict) you can create your pull request.
to accept the pull request, you must be the admin, go to pull requests and merge the new request or refuse it.
you can send pull requests to urself either, (from branch1 to branch2)

-Merging: 
n9olo rak f master branch, git merge branch1 (mergit l branch1 m3a l master, they became one)
after u merge, u wont need the branch1 so just delete it
its better to push l remote repo 1st, and create a pull request
